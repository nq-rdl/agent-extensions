## Codex execution

Use the host’s available file, search, shell, and user-question tools for this workflow. Legacy tool names and slash-qualified skill references in supporting references describe capabilities; they do not install those tools. Keep code/configuration examples for another host unchanged when authoring that host’s artifacts.

When supporting references invoke a catalog skill as /subject:facet, use $subject:facet in Codex. Preserve slash syntax inside examples that configure or document another host.

Before shell examples, set PLUGIN_ROOT to the absolute installed plugin directory: two parent directories above this SKILL.md’s containing skill directory. Derive it from the loaded file path, never the working directory. This variable is not automatically supplied to ordinary shell tools. Quote it in commands.

Here $ARGUMENTS means the user’s supplied skill arguments. Codex does not populate a shell variable for them. Pass arguments with shell quoting that preserves literal text; never evaluate user text as shell code.

# Data Request — setup

The **Data Engineer** runs setup once per project. The **Data Analyst** fills
`answers.yaml` and its optional `answers.intake.json` sidecar in one pass, then
hands the research decisions to the engineer for bootstrap and draft.
See [analyst intake contract](references/analyst-intake.rst).

Creates the `.sqlreview/` contract used by bootstrap, analyse, explain and lift.
Ordinary composition can run without setup; recording a hand-SQL candidate silently
initialises the default store when absent. **Among the record stages, setup alone accepts an
uninitialised project**: `sqlreview.sh status` exiting 3 means "proceed to init".
Arguments: `$ARGUMENTS`. `--default --yes` is the non-interactive form: take defaults, do not ask.
Treat free-text such as "take defaults, do not ask" or "non-interactive" as `--default --yes`.

```bash
S="${PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/setup/scripts"
bash "$S/sqlreview.sh" init --diff        # exit 0: all files match the bundled default
                                          # exit 10: lists new / same / differs per file (with a diff)
```

The root is the git top-level (or the cwd outside git); it is not configurable — hooks, helpers
and the other stages all resolve the same `.sqlreview/` by walking up from the cwd.

## 1. Fresh project (every file reported `new`)

`--check`: report and stop. Otherwise, unless `--default`/`--custom` was given, ask **once**
(the host user-question tool), options in this order:

- **Default (Recommended)** — the bundled template as-is: the shared definitions
  (`references/definitions.rst`), roles "Data Engineer (RDL)" / "Data Analyst", all
  report sections.
- **Custom** — ask, in one the host user-question tool call: the two role names as the team calls them. **The definitions are not customised here** — they are the workflow's shared vocabulary;
  point at `references/definitions.rst` if asked, and say a change belongs in that file.

Then confirm before writing (the host user-question tool, skipped only with `--yes`): the target path and
the file list — `config.json`, `templates/scope.md`, `templates/review.md`, `templates/lifts.md`,
`reviews/.gitkeep` (an empty placeholder, so git keeps `reviews/` in a committed `.sqlreview/`).

```bash
bash "$S/sqlreview.sh" init                # copies the bundled default; never touches existing files
```

Custom answers: after `init`, show the two role names and confirm them with the host user-question tool
(skipped only with `--yes`). Then run the helper with those answers as shell-quoted arguments:

```bash
bash "$S/sqlreview.sh" roles "<confirmed engineer role>" "<confirmed analyst role>"
```

The helper atomically updates only the two role names. It preserves `schemaVersion`, `definitions`
and all other settings. Stop on failure; do not patch or overwrite `config.json` directly.

### Requests that forbid hand-written SQL

On a fresh project or a re-run, when the request forbids hand-written SQL, tell the engineer about
`guard.require_lift_for_string_sql` in `config.json` (default `false`). When `true`, the guard hook
denies a Python or SQL write that passes a same-line f-string or concatenation to `execute`,
`executemany`, `query` or `read_sql`, unless a lift ledger entry names the file. It is experimental
and a reminder, not a sandbox: read `references/lifts.rst` (*Experimental write guard*) first, and
measure false positives on three backlog enquiries before enabling it. Enable it only after the
engineer confirms (the host user-question tool; with `--yes`, report it and leave it off), through the helper:

```bash
bash "$S/sqlreview.sh" guard string-sql on     # off to disable; updates only that key
```

## 2. Already initialised (re-run — #126 §2)

Never clobber. For each file `init --diff` reports as `differs`, show the diff and ask
(the host user-question tool): **Keep mine** / **Replace with the bundled default**. Apply only the replaced
ones:

```bash
bash "$S/sqlreview.sh" init --apply templates/review.md     # only the files the human chose
```

A `new` file (added by a newer plugin version) is applied after a single confirmation. `same`
files need nothing. Report what changed and what was kept.

### Migrating from SQL Review or SQL Code

Before removing the old plugin, inspect both project templates for `/sql-review:` or `/sql-code:`
invocations. For unchanged defaults, confirm and apply each replacement with
`init --apply templates/scope.md templates/review.md`. For customised templates,
show a targeted diff changing only `/sql-review:` or `/sql-code:` to `/data-request:` and apply the
confirmed edits, preserving custom sections and placeholders. `--check` reports
these pending changes without writing. Keeping an old invocation leaves migration
incomplete; report that explicitly.

For each existing `reviews/<slug>/scope.md` or `review.md` containing an old
invocation, rerender from its corresponding JSON after updating the template:

```bash
bash "$S/sqlreview.sh" render "<slug>" scope    # or review, for each affected report
```

Inspect any report customisations before rerendering and preserve them with the
user's chosen template edits. Verify no `/sql-review:` or `/sql-code:` invocations remain in the
active templates and reports. Do not rewrite JSON, snapshots or history; report
missing source JSON or any retained old invocations as incomplete migration.

## 3. Verify and hand over

```bash
bash "$S/sqlreview.sh" status          # exit 0 now; lists reviews (none yet on a fresh project)
```

For any `invalid` review, run `status --verbose` to name the reason. A legacy review whose slug is
not derived from any current path (a schema-1 hand-chosen slug) reports a binding mismatch; after
confirming the SQL it now describes, rebind it with `sqlreview.sh move --slug <old slug> <sql path>`.
`status --verbose` also prints `migrate=sqlreview.sh move '<path>' '<path>'` for a review under a
legacy-encoded slug (`sql__cohort%5Fpipeline__x`). It keeps working as is; the command renames it to
the readable slug (`sql__cohort_pipeline__x`) without marking it stale, then re-render its reports.

Tell the user the next stage: `$data-request:bootstrap <intended sql path>` before the SQL is
written, or `$data-request:analyse <sql path>` for SQL that already exists. Suggest committing
`.sqlreview/` — the reviews inside it are the handoff record.

Triage session state uses separate schema-1 `.sqlreview/ledger.json`, not a SQL review or
lift record. `sqlreview.sh ledger get|set` validates per-ticket entries; `ledger check FILE`
validates a stored ledger. `ledger --session get|set` uses durable local user state instead,
without initialising or writing a child. `$data-request:triage` owns its schema and resume
instructions. Roles in config remain display labels, never ledger owner/decider handles.

SQL paths are supplied explicitly to bootstrap/analyse. To customise report sections, edit the
project templates; SQL glob filtering and section flags are not configuration options.

Questions have an independent per-slug `questions.json` store: stable IDs, scope/review
applicability, owner and answered closure provenance, with no SQL revision. Read
[shared questions](references/questions.rst) before authoring/migrating or closing questions.
`questions` is read-only; `migrate-questions` retains scope/review bytes; `publish-questions`
updates only the store. Reports and release evidence use it rather than obsolete embedded
strings. Closing alone requires no carry-forward or new scope/review revision.

`fingerprint` records both `sql_sha256` (original full-file provenance) and `sql_body_sha256`
(exact body bytes after conservative leading comments). `header-only` and `scoped-header-only`
remain body-bound; `publish` records helper-owned full header hashes and timestamps in
`header_revisions`, and `render` notes them even with customised templates. Keep original
snapshots. Legacy records use their full hash or an authenticated snapshot for header comparison.
Hints, executable/nested comments, `@extract:` markers and code after a block close remain in
the body; malformed headers have no body hash. Any body edit, including whitespace or comments,
unbinds the record. Body equality never confirms changed assumptions, rationale or decisions.

`sqlreview.sh notes SQL --against REVIEW_DRAFT --confirmed-by HANDLE` additionally reports
`header_carry_over` and `header_walk` for explicitly named, dated engineer header decisions.
HANDLE is the explicitly intended human confirmer, not config role labels or `recorded_by`.
Read-only rows preserve date-only `decided.at` and show the separate observed source-commit
time; they never fill `confirmed_*`. Same-day sources are eligible from that displayed time;
precise UTC ISO cutoffs reject later sources. Analyse asks ONE answered Carry over all
question listing items and governed locations, then records `carried_basis: header-decision`.
Publish re-proves source bytes and all subsequent relevant path revisions plus working SQL.
Shallow/missing history, repeated/relocated ranges, body-prefix changes and relevant merge/
rename ambiguity are walked; unrelated PR merges with identical SQL path blobs are allowed.
Git attribution is not human authentication. Retain independent origins; no answer means
no publication. Later carryforward keeps `decided` and uses its normal confirmation fields.

`remap SLUG [DRAFT]` uses `diff -U 0` against an authenticated same-kind snapshot to update only
unchanged `location.lines` and `logic[].lines` in a draft. It reports `{document, prior_revision,
remapped, walk}`; changed or ambiguous ranges remain untouched for reassessment. Default:
`review.draft.json` when a review exists, otherwise `scope.draft.json`; absent default drafts are
seeded from the published record, existing drafts are preserved. An explicit draft must be a
JSON file directly inside that slug's directory, never `scope.json`, `review.json` or `lifts.json`.
It is retry-safe and atomic on failure. Missing baseline exits 6; corrupt evidence exits 2;
invalid draft ranges/binding exit 4. It never publishes, confirms, increments revisions, refreshes
fingerprints or advances snapshots. See analyse/bootstrap's update paths before carryforward.
