  behaviour, in bash 5 and zsh 5.9 with GNU and BusyBox awk.

## Codex execution

Before shell examples, set PLUGIN_ROOT to the absolute installed plugin directory: two parent directories above this SKILL.md’s containing skill directory. Derive it from the loaded file path, never the working directory. This variable is not automatically supplied to ordinary shell tools. Quote it in commands.

# Bitwarden Personal PM — .env & Dev Secrets

Use the Bitwarden **personal** Password Manager CLI (`bw`) to keep development
secrets in the vault and load them into a shell on demand, instead of leaving a
plaintext `.env` on disk.

> **This is not Secrets Manager.** `bw` is the personal Password Manager;
> Bitwarden Secrets Manager is a different product with the `bws` CLI. See the
> [Password Manager overview](https://bitwarden.com/help/password-manager-overview/)
> and the [Secrets Manager overview](https://bitwarden.com/help/secrets-manager-overview/).

## Install and authenticate

```bash
npm install -g @bitwarden/cli    # or: brew install bitwarden-cli / snap install bw
bw login                          # interactive, once per machine
export BW_SESSION="$(bw unlock --raw)"
```

For CI and cron, use `bw login --apikey` (`BW_CLIENTID`, `BW_CLIENTSECRET`)
and `bw unlock --passwordenv BW_PASSWORD --raw`, never interactive unlock.

## Use the shell functions in `scripts/bw-env.sh`

[scripts/bw-env.sh](scripts/bw-env.sh) is the one implementation of the
`.env` functions. Tell the user to `source` it from `~/.bashrc` or `~/.zshrc`
(or copy it there). Do not retype the functions from memory: the details below
are what hand-written versions get wrong.

| Function | What it does |
|---|---|
| `bwc <item> [file]` | Create a Secure Note from a `.env` file (default `./.env`) |
| `bwu <item> [file]` | Replace an existing item's notes from a `.env` file |
| `bwe <item>` | Load the note's variables into the current shell |
| `bwunload <item>` | Unset the variables that item exports |
| `bwl [search]` / `bwll [search]` | List item names / names with IDs |
| `bwf <item> <field>` | Print one custom field of a Login item (capture it with `$(...)`) |
| `bwdotenv <item> [file]` | Write a plaintext `.env` for tools that need a file |
| `bwdd <item>` | Move an item to the trash |
| `bwss` | Unlock once per shell; the others call it |

What the script guarantees (covered by `tests/test_bitwarden_bw_env.py` in the
source repository, using a fake `bw`):

- **Storage format.** `bwc`/`bwu` store each line as `export NAME='value'`,
  keeping comments and blank lines. They accept `NAME=value`, `export
  NAME=value`, and single- or double-quoted values, and drop ` # comment` after
  an unquoted value. Values are literal: there is no `$VAR` interpolation.
- **No echo of secrets.** `bw create item` and `bw edit item` print the whole
  item, notes included. The script discards that output and prints only the
  item ID, so the values never reach the terminal or an agent transcript.
- **No arbitrary eval.** `bwe` refuses a note with any line other than a plain
  `export NAME=...`, so a hand-edited note cannot run commands.
- Works in bash and zsh, including under `set -u`.

When you drive `bw` directly instead of through the script, keep the same
rules: pipe `bw create`/`bw edit` output to `jq -r .id`, and never put a secret
on the command line (`--arg secret ghp_...` lands in shell history); read it
with `read -rs` first.

## Vault naming

Use predictable names so `bwl <project>` groups them:

```
<project>-<env>          myapp-dev, myapp-staging   (Secure Note, full .env)
<service>-credentials    aws-credentials            (Login, custom fields)
```

## Security rules

1. **`BW_SESSION` decrypts the whole vault.** Keep it in shell memory only:
   never write it to a file, log it, or pass it to `set -x` output.
2. **Use item IDs in lasting scripts** (`bw get notes <uuid>`); names can be
   duplicated, and `bw` errors on ambiguous names.
3. **Run `bw sync`** before reading data that may have changed elsewhere.
4. **Delete `bwdotenv` output after use** and keep `.env` in `.gitignore`.
5. **Mask values in CI logs.** A secret written to `$GITHUB_ENV` is not
   masked automatically; see [references/env-patterns.rst](references/env-patterns.rst).
6. **Secrets Manager is not this.** If a request needs `bws`, machine accounts,
   or projects, say this skill does not cover it.

## Common patterns

- **Several environments:** `bwe myapp-dev`, later `bwunload myapp-dev &&
  bwe myapp-staging`.
- **One token, many variable names:**
  [scripts/load-github.sh](scripts/load-github.sh) loads a token stored as a
  Secure Note by UUID and exports it as `GITHUB_TOKEN`, `GITHUB_OAUTH_TOKEN`,
  and `GIT_TOKEN`. It is written as a zsh autoload function file.
- **Structured credentials:** store AWS or database keys as hidden custom
  fields (type 1) on a Login item and read them with `bwf`:
  `export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="$(bwf aws-credentials AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID)"`.
