## Codex execution

Delegation is optional. Read references/subagent.rst only when delegation is useful or requested. It does not install a named agent or grant permissions.

# Test

Inspect module inputs, expected outputs, and existing Go test conventions. Build staged Terratest coverage with unique resource names, reliable cleanup, and negative cases. Separate local validation from cloud tests that create billable resources and report which ran.

## Optional delegation

[references/subagent.rst](references/subagent.rst) contains the subagent outline,
handoff inputs, execution boundaries, and expected result. Read it when delegating
would help or the user asks to “create a subagent to execute this.” Otherwise,
work directly from this skill; the reference does not need to be loaded.
