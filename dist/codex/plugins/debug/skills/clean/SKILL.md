## Codex execution

Delegation is optional. Read references/subagent.rst only when delegation is useful or requested. It does not install a named agent or grant permissions.

# Clean

Establish which code and dependencies are actually used before removing anything. Simplify one concern at a time and validate retained behavior after each change. Preserve meaningful tests and public contracts; report deletions and verification.

## Optional delegation

[references/subagent.rst](references/subagent.rst) contains the subagent outline,
handoff inputs, execution boundaries, and expected result. Read it when delegating
would help or the user asks to “create a subagent to execute this.” Otherwise,
work directly from this skill; the reference does not need to be loaded.
