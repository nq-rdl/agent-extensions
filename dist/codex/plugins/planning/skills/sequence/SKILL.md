## Codex execution

Delegation is optional. Read references/subagent.rst only when delegation is useful or requested. It does not install a named agent or grant permissions.

# Sequence

Map affected files, dependencies, existing patterns, and test coverage before implementation. Return an ordered edit plan with ripple effects and potential breaking changes. This task produces a plan; it does not authorize implementation.

## Optional delegation

[references/subagent.rst](references/subagent.rst) contains the subagent outline,
handoff inputs, execution boundaries, and expected result. Read it when delegating
would help or the user asks to “create a subagent to execute this.” Otherwise,
work directly from this skill; the reference does not need to be loaded.
