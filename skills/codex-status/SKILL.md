## Preflight — Node.js runtime

Before running the companion, verify Node >=18.18.0:

```bash
node --version >/dev/null 2>&1 && node -e 'const [a,b]=process.versions.node.split(".").map(Number); process.exit(a>18||(a===18&&b>=18)?0:1)'
```

If that check fails (non-zero exit or `node` not found), stop and tell the user exactly: `Codex plugin requires Node.js >=18.18.0; install or upgrade Node: https://nodejs.org/en/download`. Do not surface a raw `command not found` or version error.

## Run

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/codex-companion.mjs" status "$ARGUMENTS"
```

If the user did not pass a job ID:
- Render the command output as a single Markdown table for the current and past runs in this session.
- Keep it compact. Do not include progress blocks or extra prose outside the table.
- Preserve the actionable fields from the command output, including job ID, kind, status, phase, elapsed or duration, summary, and follow-up commands.

If the user did pass a job ID:
- Present the full command output to the user.
- Do not summarize or condense it.
