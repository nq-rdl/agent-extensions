# Strategy

Establish the goal, constraints, current architecture, and unresolved decisions. Compare viable approaches and produce a high-level implementation strategy with risks and validation criteria. Keep code unchanged; use the sequence skill when a file-by-file edit order is needed.

## Optional delegation

[references/subagent.rst](references/subagent.rst) contains the subagent outline,
handoff inputs, execution boundaries, and expected result. Read it when delegating
would help or the user asks to “create a subagent to execute this.” Otherwise,
work directly from this skill; the reference does not need to be loaded.
