## Preflight — Node.js runtime

Before running the defect CLI, verify Node >=18.18.0:

```bash
node --version >/dev/null 2>&1 && node -e 'const [a,b]=process.versions.node.split(".").map(Number); process.exit(a>18||(a===18&&b>=18)?0:1)'
```

If that check fails (non-zero exit or `node` not found), stop and tell the user exactly: `Codex plugin requires Node.js >=18.18.0; install or upgrade Node: https://nodejs.org/en/download`. Do not surface a raw `command not found` or version error.

## Reporting procedure

Set `PLUGIN_ROOT` to the installed `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` directory for the
commands in [references/reporting.rst](references/reporting.rst). Read and follow
that shared procedure before inspecting, drafting, filing, or marking a defect.
Pass the user-supplied defect ID literally; use the latest marker only when no ID
was supplied. The procedure owns verdict, privacy, draft-approval, and outcome gates.

## Codex packaging

For execution in a native Codex package, use the host-specific entrypoint in
[references/codex.rst](references/codex.rst). The registry selects it during packaging;
the Claude entrypoint above remains the Claude workflow.
