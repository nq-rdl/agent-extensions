# Build Mcp

Inspect the project’s Go SDK version and transport before changing an MCP server. Use typed tool inputs and outputs, propagate context cancellation, and test handlers and failure paths. Verify API details against the official github.com/modelcontextprotocol/go-sdk source for that version.

## Optional delegation

[references/subagent.rst](references/subagent.rst) contains the subagent outline,
handoff inputs, execution boundaries, and expected result. Read it when delegating
would help or the user asks to “create a subagent to execute this.” Otherwise,
work directly from this skill; the reference does not need to be loaded.
