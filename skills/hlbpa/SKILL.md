# Architecture

Document interfaces, data flows, contracts, and boundary failure modes from source evidence. Keep implementation code and tests unchanged; write only the requested documentation. Mark unknowns explicitly and use accessible Mermaid diagrams where they clarify the architecture.

## Optional delegation

[references/subagent.rst](references/subagent.rst) contains the subagent outline,
handoff inputs, execution boundaries, and expected result. Read it when delegating
would help or the user asks to “create a subagent to execute this.” Otherwise,
work directly from this skill; the reference does not need to be loaded.
