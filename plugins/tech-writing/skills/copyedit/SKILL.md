  Apply the house technical-writing style when writing or copyediting
  documentation, READMEs, how-to guides, runbooks, and docs-site pages. Use
  when asked to copyedit, proofread, tidy, or "make this read better", when
  drafting user-facing docs, or when a reviewer asks which person, mood,
  punctuation, spelling, or heading case to use (en-AU, spaced en dash,
  imperative instructions, purpose before action, no e.g. or i.e.).
argument-hint: "Paste or point at the prose to copyedit, or say what you are about to write (for example 'README install section')"

# Tech writing – copyedit to house style

These are the *decisions* a fresh writer makes inconsistently, not a grammar
lesson – your default grammar is fine. Long form, tables, and examples live in
`references/house-style.rst`.

## Locale: en-AU, spaced en dash, sentence-case headings

- Spell in **Australian English** (organise, colour, catalogue, *licence* noun
  / *license* verb; *program* in every sense). If a project already spells
  consistently in another locale, keep it – never flip a locale in a copyedit.
- Set off a parenthetical with a **spaced en dash** ( – ), never an em dash
  (—). Ranges take an unspaced en dash (10–20 ms) and **never** "from 10–20"
  or "between 2024–2026" – with *from* or *between*, write *to* or *and*.
- **Sentence case for every heading**, H1 included; capitalise proper nouns
  and the first word after a colon. This deviates from the Proxmox origin
  (title case for H1–H2) to match the Style Manual and Microsoft.
- Dates in prose: 27 August 2026. Numeric dates for people: 27/8/2026.
  ISO 8601 only in data and filenames.

## Person and mood follow the content type

| Content | Person and mood | Never |
|---|---|---|
| Description – what a thing is or does | Third-person indicative: "The scheduler retries failed jobs." | "one", "I" |
| Instruction – what the reader does | Second-person imperative, present tense: "Insert the card." | modal verbs (*should*, *could*, *might*), "I", "we" |
| Recommendation | "We recommend …" is the one permitted "we" | – |

Prefer "To create a container, run …" over "You can create a container by …".
Blog posts and personal write-ups use first person; documentation does not.

## Front-load what the reader needs

- **Instructions: purpose, then action**, so the reader can skip a step whose
  purpose does not apply: "To delete the entire document, click **Delete**."
  Not "Click Delete if you want to delete the entire document."
- **Descriptions: subject first**, purpose after: "Proxmox VE offers a RESTful
  API to integrate with third-party tools." Not "To integrate with …, Proxmox
  VE offers …".

## Procedures and lists

- A procedure gets a gerund heading ("Closing the program") and an intro
  sentence that adds context without repeating the heading.
- **A single-step procedure is a bullet, not "1."**
- Sub-steps are `a.`, `b.`; sub-sub-steps are `i.`, `ii.`.
- **"Press Enter" belongs inside the step it completes**, never as its own step.
- Average 15–20 words a sentence; three or more items inline become a list.
- One style per list: **all** full sentences ending in a full stop, or **all**
  fragments with no end punctuation. Never mix.
- Term-and-definition items bold the term; link-and-description items put the
  link first and indent the description beneath.

## Punctuation and word decisions

- Oxford comma in lists of three or more.
- A slash means a combination (TCP/IP, client/server). **Never use a slash for
  "or"** – write "product or service".
- *command-line tool* but *the command line*; *e-book*, *e-commerce*, but
  *email*.
- Contractions are fine (*it's*, *don't*); never contract a noun
  ("Proxmox's the leading …").
- No *approx.* (write "about"), no *etc.*, no *e.g.* or *i.e.* – write
  "for example" and "that is". If a template forces them, it is "e.g.," and
  "i.e.," with the comma.
- **Do not introduce an acronym you use only once.** Otherwise spell it out on
  first use with the acronym in brackets – "Kernel Samepage Merging (KSM)".
  USB, HTML, URL, API, CPU, SSH need no expansion.
- Singular *they*; *data* is singular.

## Terminology

- One term per concept for the whole document. On first use, add the synonyms
  readers search for, in brackets: "a USB flash drive (USB stick)".
- Keep an *Instead of → Use* terms table in the project's docs and extend it
  when you settle a choice (starter table in the reference).
- **The brand is not the product.** "Proxmox 3.4" names nothing – write
  "Proxmox VE 3.4". Use the vendor's casing (CentOS, VMware, macOS).
- An example is correct and tested, or it is not there.

## Copyedit pass

1. Name the content type (description, instruction, recommendation) and set
   person and mood accordingly.
2. Fix front-loading, modal verbs, and first person.
3. Fix procedures and lists (single-step bullet, Enter inside the step,
   consistent list punctuation).
4. Fix words: abbreviations, acronyms, one term per concept, en-AU spelling.
5. Fix punctuation: Oxford comma, slash, hyphen, spaced en dash; heading case.
6. Report each change as *before → after* with the rule that drove it.

Do not change meaning, code, commands, file paths, UI labels, or quoted
program output. Leave a project's existing locale alone.

Worked example: "You should click Save to save the file, e.g. before exiting"
→ "To save the file before exiting, click **Save**." (purpose first, no modal,
no *e.g.*).

## Verify against the canonical sources

Where this file is silent and being wrong would mislead, read the source
instead of guessing. Where this file *conflicts* with a source – en-AU
spelling, the spaced en dash, sentence-case headings – this file wins.
