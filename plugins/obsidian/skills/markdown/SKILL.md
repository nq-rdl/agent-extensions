# Obsidian Flavored Markdown Skill

Create and edit valid Obsidian Flavored Markdown. Obsidian extends CommonMark and GFM with wikilinks, embeds, callouts, properties, comments, and other syntax. This skill covers only Obsidian-specific extensions -- standard Markdown (headings, bold, italic, lists, quotes, code blocks, tables) is assumed knowledge.

When exact syntax matters and could differ from the tested source, verify it against the canonical docs at https://help.obsidian.md.

## Workflow: Creating an Obsidian Note

1. **Add frontmatter** with properties (tags, aliases, plus any custom properties) at the top of the file. The file name is the note title and link target; a `title:` property is an ordinary custom property. See [PROPERTIES.rst](references/PROPERTIES.rst) for all property types.
2. **Write content** using standard Markdown for structure, plus Obsidian-specific syntax below.
3. **Link related notes** using wikilinks (`[[Note]]`) for internal vault connections, or standard Markdown links for external URLs.
4. **Embed content** from other notes, images, or PDFs using the `![[embed]]` syntax. See [EMBEDS.rst](references/EMBEDS.rst) for all embed types.
5. **Add callouts** for highlighted information using `> [!type]` syntax. See [CALLOUTS.rst](references/CALLOUTS.rst) for all callout types.
6. **Verify** the note renders correctly in Obsidian's reading view.

> When choosing between wikilinks and Markdown links: use `[[wikilinks]]` for notes within the vault (Obsidian tracks renames automatically) and `[text](url)` for external URLs only.

## Internal Links (Wikilinks)

```markdown
[[Note Name]]                          Link to note
[[Note Name|Display Text]]             Custom display text
[[Note Name#Heading]]                  Link to heading
[[Note Name#^block-id]]                Link to block
[[#Heading in same note]]              Same-note heading link
```

Define a block ID by appending `^block-id` to any paragraph:

```markdown
This paragraph can be linked to. ^my-block-id
```

For lists, quotes, callouts, and tables, place the block ID on a separate line with a blank line before and after it. Block IDs may contain only Latin letters, numbers, and dashes.

```markdown
> A quote block

^quote-id
```

## Embeds

Prefix any wikilink with `!` to embed its content inline:

```markdown
![[Note Name]]                         Embed full note
![[Note Name#Heading]]                 Embed section
![[image.png]]                         Embed image
![[image.png|300]]                     Embed image with width
![[document.pdf#page=3]]               Embed PDF page
```

See [EMBEDS.rst](references/EMBEDS.rst) for audio, video, search embeds, and external images.

## Callouts

```markdown
> [!note]
> Basic callout.

> [!warning] Custom Title
> Callout with a custom title.

> [!faq]- Collapsed by default
> Foldable callout (- collapsed, + expanded).
```

Common types: `note`, `tip`, `warning`, `info`, `example`, `quote`, `bug`, `danger`, `success`, `failure`, `question`, `abstract`, `todo`.

See [CALLOUTS.rst](references/CALLOUTS.rst) for the full list with aliases, nesting, and custom CSS callouts.

## Properties (Frontmatter)

```yaml
---
date: 2024-01-15
tags:
  - project
  - active
aliases:
  - Alternative Name
cssclasses:
  - custom-class
---
```

Default properties: `tags` (searchable labels), `aliases` (alternative note names for link suggestions), `cssclasses` (CSS classes for styling). Any other name, such as `date` or `title`, is a custom property; `title` does not change the note title, which is the file name.

See [PROPERTIES.rst](references/PROPERTIES.rst) for all property types, tag syntax rules, and advanced usage.

## Tags

```markdown
#tag                    Inline tag
#nested/tag             Nested tag with hierarchy
```

Tags can contain letters, numbers, underscores, hyphens, forward slashes, and common Unicode characters including emoji, but no spaces. A tag must contain at least one non-numeric character: `#1984` is invalid, `#y1984` is valid. Tags can also be defined in frontmatter under the `tags` property.

## Comments

```markdown
This is visible %%but this is hidden%% text.

%%
This entire block is hidden in reading view.
%%
```

Comments are visible only in Editing view.

## Obsidian-Specific Formatting

```markdown
==Highlighted text==                   Highlight syntax
```

## Math (LaTeX)

```markdown
Inline: $e^{i\pi} + 1 = 0$

Block:
$$
\frac{a}{b} = c
$$
```

## Diagrams (Mermaid)

````markdown
```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Start] --> B{Decision}
    B -->|Yes| C[Do this]
    B -->|No| D[Do that]
```
````

To link Mermaid nodes to Obsidian notes, add `class NodeName internal-link;`. Quote note names that contain special characters (`class "⨳ special character" internal-link`). These links do not appear in Graph view.

## Footnotes

```markdown
Text with a footnote[^1].

[^1]: Footnote content.

Inline footnote.^[This is inline.]
```

Inline footnotes render only in Reading view, not in Live Preview.
