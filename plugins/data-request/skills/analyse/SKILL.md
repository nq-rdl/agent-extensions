# Data Request — analyse (Data Engineer)

The **Data Engineer** runs analyse. Keep the Data Analyst's imported research
decisions and provenance visible; confirm technical SQL findings with the
engineer. Any research question missed by intake belongs to the analyst:
prefix its shared question's text `Analyst question:` and send it back through
the handoff for the analyst to consult the requester. Do not relabel an
engineer confirmation as an analyst confirmation.

For RDL cohort SQL, read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/guardrails/SKILL.md` before
scoping or reviewing. Consult its dataops/column-spec sources and carry evidence or
unverified facts into the discussion; advisory findings do not replace human confirmation.

Arguments: `$ARGUMENTS`.

```bash
S="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/setup/scripts"
bash "$S/sqlreview.sh" status --json                # exit 3 → stop: not initialised, run /data-request:setup first
SLUG="$(bash "$S/sqlreview.sh" slug "<sql path>")"  # exit 5 → bound to another path: offer `sqlreview.sh move OLD NEW`;
                                                    # a stderr legacy-review note → offer its `move --slug OLD_SLUG NEW`
bash "$S/sqlreview.sh" fingerprint "<sql path>"     # {sql_path, sql_sha256, sql_body_sha256, git_commit, git_dirty} — embed as-is
```

Read `definitions` from `.sqlreview/config.json` and use that wording verbatim when deciding and
explaining what is an assumption and what is a limitation; never paraphrase it. If
`reviews/$SLUG/scope.json` exists, Read it — the review is written *against* the scope. If it does
not, offer `/data-request:bootstrap` retroactively once, then continue without it if declined.

Before the delta/unchanged-SQL path, apply guardrails `references/grain.rst`: compare
intake/scope and each output's actual grain with answers. Reuse one `L-grain-answers`
drift record and offer an answers correction in the same change; preserve expected
finer outputs. Bare Patient is not an agreed grain or a reason to change released SQL.

## Before presenting prose (fresh or update)

**Name the constant, never its value** in scope/review prose, drafts, logic descriptions,
questions and change summaries (for example, `EVENT_CD`, not its numeric value).
`code-value` scans string fields for maximal runs of 8 to 10 digits, except validated
machine metadata (SQL path/bound slug, fingerprints and ISO timestamps at known locations).
Keep that metadata as-is; lint exemptions do not waive `check` or publication validation.
Never add prose codes to `.pii-code-values` or suppress the PII gate to clear them.

Before every question batch or displayed summary, stage the proposed wording in
`.sqlreview/reviews/$SLUG/review.draft.json`, including stored prose, recurring suggestions,
delta/impact explanations and `bulk`/`walk` questions. Inspect raw helper output locally;
do not paste it into questions. Run:

```bash
bash "$S/sqlreview.sh" lint --ste ".sqlreview/reviews/$SLUG/review.draft.json"
# exit 10 → <id>\t<field>\t<rule>\t<detail>, without code values; other failures → stop
```

Replace each prose code with its constant name and fix STE wording before showing it.
Re-run lint after edits; decision-source warnings require a source check, not a made-up source.
Reworded confirmed items need fresh human confirmation; do not retain their carried
confirmation or edit the final JSON. Lint cannot grant confirmation. A reworded scope
item no longer matches its scope text, so it is walked.

Some decisions recur in every enquiry (#362). Before you put candidate items to the engineer, run
`bash "$S/recurring-decisions.sh" match ".sqlreview/reviews/$SLUG/review.draft.json"`. For each other match,
show the prior enquiries, offer the listed wording and mark the item `upstream`, as
`${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/setup/references/recurring-decisions.rst` says. The engineer still confirms each other item;
the exact recorded TUH house default is not a fresh facility question. Preserve its upstream origin,
and verify the SQL implementation during review.
Rows from `carryforward` include recorded `upstream` and `decided`: preserve them.
Rows from `carryover` omit `upstream`: copy it from the scope item when you re-draft.

## Decision origin (#434)

Keep decision origin separate from engineer confirmation. When evidence identifies the
decider, attach optional `decided: {by, role, at, source}` to the item: a human handle,
role, decision date or ISO time, and comment/PR URL or dated document reference.
Use `unlinked (verbal)` for a reported verbal decision; never invent a source, decider
or date from rationale wording. If origin is unknown, omit `decided` and surface the
attribution question. Show the provenance with the item before confirmation.
Preserve `decided` verbatim when re-drafting, including header candidates, carryover
and carryforward; adding, changing or removing it requires fresh confirmation. Run plain
`lint` before publish: provenance warnings need a source check, separate from wording
reconfirmation. A lint hint is advisory; it does not establish who decided.

## Pre-run plausibility: operator proposals only

Before the delta/unchanged-SQL path, read guardrails `references/performance.rst`,
**Pre-run plausibility**. Compare the population answers in scope with the current SQL;
carry unresolved or contradicted limits into the review and analyst questions without
inventing restrictions. Return the inventory and a proposed count-only probe for **each label column**
across all final outputs, including expected labels/format, SQL location, bounds/cost and suppression.
For expensive requests only, propose an age-band probe with the scoped age anchor and cost evidence.
This check runs **no SQL**: mark proposals **proposed, not executed**, not OBSERVED findings.
Reuse valid existing proposals on reruns but recheck scope, output columns and bounds even if SQL
is unchanged. Show this proposal table alongside `review.md`, not as a confirmed probe result.
Unknown labels/thresholds remain unverified; do not fabricate confirmations to publish a review.

The operator needs explicit authorisation to run approved probes before the delivery run.
Returned counts inform UAT and the data dictionary; surprises go to the analyst, not an automatic
cohort filter. Before showing counts, apply guardrails `references/release.rst`, **Probe disclosure control**. Apply *After review* below for the separate authorised run and handoff.

## Existing review → update path (#130 §2)

If `reviews/$SLUG/review.json` exists (or `--update`):

```bash
bash "$S/sqlreview.sh" delta "$SLUG"     # exit 0 → check review-content changes before completion below · 10 changed · 6 no baseline → full review below (retain revision history) · 2 missing SQL → stop/rebind
```

### Unchanged SQL: complete publication before stopping

Only when the grain precheck requires no review-content change, use this exit-0
completion path. Otherwise bypass this early return and take *Metadata-only changes*
below. `delta` compares SQL bytes, not intake, answers or review content.

On exit 0, the SQL body remains bound, including `header-only` status. Inspect a header-only
diff and run `notes "<sql path>" --against ".sqlreview/reviews/$SLUG/review.json"` before
completion. A body match does not confirm changed assumption text or rationale: reconcile
those differences and obtain fresh confirmation through the update path. For wording-only
header corrections that leave the confirmed record intact, publish that record again to
record the header revision, then render it.
A previous run may have published and snapshotted successfully but failed or stopped
before question publication or rendering. This recovery uses the existing confirmed
revision; do not increment it or ask for its confirmations again. If the declared
store is missing, Read the retained `questions.draft.json` and check its binding and
answers before retrying publication. Do not invent a replacement if the draft is
missing, or overwrite an invalid existing store. Run from the project root:

```bash
bash "$S/sqlreview.sh" publish "$SLUG" review ".sqlreview/reviews/$SLUG/review.json" || exit $?
if ! bash "$S/sqlreview.sh" questions "$SLUG" review >/dev/null; then
  # Recover only a missing first store, never repair an existing invalid one implicitly.
  [ ! -e ".sqlreview/reviews/$SLUG/questions.json" ] && [ ! -L ".sqlreview/reviews/$SLUG/questions.json" ] || exit 4
  [ -f ".sqlreview/reviews/$SLUG/questions.draft.json" ] || { echo "Missing question draft; handoff incomplete" >&2; exit 4; }
  bash "$S/sqlreview.sh" publish-questions "$SLUG" ".sqlreview/reviews/$SLUG/questions.draft.json" || exit $?
fi
bash "$S/sqlreview.sh" render "$SLUG" review || exit $?
if jq -e -s 'length == 2 and (.[0] | del(.header_revisions)) == (.[1] | del(.header_revisions))' \
    ".sqlreview/reviews/$SLUG/review.draft.json" ".sqlreview/reviews/$SLUG/review.json" >/dev/null 2>&1; then
  rm -f ".sqlreview/reviews/$SLUG/review.draft.json"
fi
if [ -e ".sqlreview/reviews/$SLUG/review.draft.json" ]; then
  printf 'Stop: review draft contains unpublished work; retain it for completion.\n' >&2
  exit 4
fi
```

Show `review.md`. Review draft equality is semantic, ignoring only helper-owned
`header_revisions`; formatting and header history are not unpublished work. Keep any
differing or unreadable review or question draft and tell the user it contains
unpublished work; do not discard it or publish it automatically over a valid store.
Stop before *After review* when unpublished work remains; continue below only when
no unpublished draft remains. If question publication or rendering fails, retain
both drafts and report the handoff incomplete; retry this completion step once
the cause is fixed.

### Metadata-only changes: update despite unchanged SQL

On exit 0, a newly confirmed grain, a need to add or revise `L-grain-answers`, or a
correction to retire a resolved drift finding requires a review update. Compare the
precheck with the published review; do not increment merely because the check ran.
An unconfirmed proposal stays in the draft/handoff until answered; it is not published
by this path or discarded by completion.

For a required update, there are no SQL hunks or impact hints to walk. Continue at
steps 3–4 of *Changed SQL* below: draft the next revision, run `carryforward`, reassess
items implicated by the grain/evidence change even when their SQL lines are unchanged,
increment the revision and append to `changes[]`. Then follow *Confirm, write, render*,
including confirmation/carry gates and publish → snapshot → render. Do not change SQL
or auto-confirm a new or reworded item to make this update possible.

### Changed SQL: reassess the review

On exit 10, continue with impact hints and the update below:

```bash
bash "$S/sqlreview.sh" impact "$SLUG"    # HINTS ONLY: identifiers from the changed lines traced into unchanged lines
```

1. Before discussing the delta, stage explanations and questions in the review draft and run
   the pre-presentation lint above. Inspect hunks locally; do not paste raw delta output or
   numeric code values into the discussion. Walk the human through each hunk with the linted explanation:
   what it changes about grain, filters, joins or output, naming constants rather than values.
   Repeat the check for each hunk's questions, then pause (AskUserQuestion: **Continue** / **Discuss**).
2. Stage and lint the impact discussion before showing hints as *places to look*, then check
   the unchanged code yourself for indirect consequences the hints cannot see (a changed literal, join type or `DISTINCT` shifts grain
   without touching an identifier). Confirm or dismiss each candidate with the human.
3. **Reassess the existing assumptions and limitations.** Draft the next revision keeping each
   unchanged item's `id`, `text` and `rationale` verbatim and its old ranges. Compute unchanged
   `location.lines` and `logic[].lines` from the authenticated baseline, then find which keep
   their confirmation (#348):

   ```bash
   bash "$S/sqlreview.sh" remap "$SLUG" ".sqlreview/reviews/$SLUG/review.draft.json"
   # → {document, prior_revision, remapped: [{kind, id, from, to}], walk: [{kind, id, lines, why}]}
   bash "$S/sqlreview.sh" carryforward "$SLUG" review ".sqlreview/reviews/$SLUG/review.draft.json"
   # → {prior_revision, revision, sql_unchanged, sql_body_unchanged, carry: [{kind, id, basis, set}],
   #    bulk: [{kind, id, text, rationale, location, why}], walk: [{kind, id, why}]}
   ```

   `remap` edits only draft ranges, never confirmations or fingerprints. Its `walk` ranges
   stay untouched: reassess their current lines with the human, including affected logic steps,
   before using `carryforward`. Repeated governed text present in an edit is conservatively
   ambiguous, not proof of a safe remap. New/manual ranges stay yours; retries do not shift twice.
   With no draft argument, it seeds or updates `review.draft.json` from the published record
   (scope when no review exists); set the next revision and fresh fingerprint yourself.

   Copy each `carry` item's `set` fields (with `carried_basis`) onto it verbatim; do not ask
   again. Re-run the pre-presentation lint before each `bulk`/`walk` question batch, including
   stored and newly drafted items; reworded carried items need fresh confirmation.
   Ask the `bulk` items once, with their `location` lines, as
   [references/carry.rst](references/carry.rst) describes. Confirm / reword / drop the `walk` items
   (hint-flagged first), plus any `carry` item the hunks or hints implicate indirectly, and add
   new ones. When the human asks for a full re-walk, walk every item and publish with `--reconfirm-all`.
   Seed new header items as in *Rendered header* below, `--against` the published `review.json`.
4. Set `revision` to the previous value + 1, append to `changes[]` `{revision, at, by, summary}`.
   Then *Confirm, write, render* below.

A missing baseline is still an update: preserve the existing `changes[]`, increment the previous
revision, and reassess every item `carryforward` does not list under `carry` (without a baseline
only an unchanged SQL SHA can carry). Never reset an existing review to revision 1.

## Full review

Read the SQL. Draft into `reviews/$SLUG/review.draft.json` (guard-exempt) as you go:

- **purpose** — one paragraph, in the analyst's terms.
- **inputs** — every source with what one row means; **outputs** — `grain` plus each column.
- **logic** — numbered steps with the SQL line range each covers (`lines: [from, to]`): CTE by CTE,
  then the final select; joins, filters and aggregations named explicitly.
- **assumptions** — every place the SQL commits to one reading where the request allowed more;
  **limitations** — every constraint the analyst must know before relying on the output. Give
  each the `location` lines it governs and a one-line rationale. Where an item restates a
  confirmed scope item that still holds, keep the scope's `text` and `rationale` verbatim so it
  can be carried over (below); copy its optional `decided` object verbatim, preserving the original actor,
  role, source and date-only precision, separate from the review confirmer. Decision origin does not supply confirmation.
  Reword only where the SQL changed what is true; retain the origin of any decision that still applies.
- **questions.json** — load `bash "$S/sqlreview.sh" questions "$SLUG" review` on every
  resume: it includes the scope's questions and review-only questions. Never seed a second
  list from scope. Follow `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/setup/references/questions.rst`;
  migrate legacy strings once, retain stable IDs, owner and closure provenance. Add SQL-specific
  open rows with `applies: review`; close only from an evidenced answer with `publish-questions`.
  Closure alone changes no scope/review revision or confirmation. Publish the question draft
  after the first review publication and before render; failures leave the handoff incomplete.

### Rendered header (#355)

SQL generated by query-builder 0.6.0+ may open with the assumptions and limitations its
pipeline recorded ([contract](https://github.com/nq-rdl/query-builder/blob/main/docs/ANALYSIS_NOTES.md)):

```bash
bash "$S/sqlreview.sh" notes "<sql path>" --against ".sqlreview/reviews/$SLUG/scope.json"  # drop --against if no scope
# → {present, lines, assumptions|limitations: [{text, rationale, lines, match}]} · exit 4 malformed → report the line, continue without it
```

Header items are candidates, not confirmed items: each still goes to the human under
*Confirm, write, render*, never confirmed because the pipeline recorded it. Seed each with the header
text verbatim, `"status": "candidate"` and its `rationale` (a limitation's consequence; draft one
with the human if null); where `match` names an existing item, keep that item's id, text and
rationale verbatim instead, so carryover/carryforward still recognise it. Set `location` to the
SQL lines the item governs, not the header `lines`. Then review the SQL for what the header
omits; `present: false` is not evidence of no assumptions.

## Confirm, write, render

Apply the pre-presentation lint above before each batch below, the carry-over question included (#394).

The human-in-the-loop trigger (#130 §1.1). On an update, items `carryforward` listed under
`carry` are already settled: leave them out of everything below. First, when a scope exists,
find what bootstrap already settled:

```bash
bash "$S/sqlreview.sh" carryover "$SLUG" ".sqlreview/reviews/$SLUG/review.draft.json"
# → {scope_revision, sql_unchanged, sql_body_unchanged, scope_before_sql, carry_over: [{kind, id,
#    scope_id, basis, text, rationale, location, decided?}], carry_over_intent: [same], walk: [{kind, id, why, decided?}]}
```

`carry_over` and `carry_over_intent` list draft items whose list, text and rationale match a
confirmed item of the current scope revision; `basis` is the evidence. Check the SQL against
each, then ask each non-empty list as **one** question, as
[references/carry.rst](references/carry.rst) describes: `carry_over` (the SQL under the item did
not change) with **Carry over all (Recommended)**, `carry_over_intent` (the SQL changed or came
after the scope) with a delta summary and no recommended option. Every item shows its `location`.
Copy each row's optional `decided` onto the draft item verbatim, including matched scope items
returned under `walk`; never replace it with the new confirmer or confirmation timestamp.
Do not invent an origin when absent.

### Named dated header decisions (#431)

For remaining candidates, establish the **explicit intended human confirmer's handle** before
running the command below. Ask if it is not explicitly known; do not infer it from config
`roles` (display labels), `recorded_by`, git author/committer or the header decider. Header/git
bytes prove recorded attribution, not human identity or an answer.

```bash
bash "$S/sqlreview.sh" notes "<sql path>" \
  --against ".sqlreview/reviews/$SLUG/review.draft.json" --confirmed-by "<human handle>"
# → header_carry_over: [{kind, id, text, rationale, location, basis:"header-decision",
#                      decided:{by,role,at,source}, evidence:{commit,committed_at,precision,...}}]
#   header_walk: [{kind,id,text,rationale,location,why}]
```

Exclude items already settled by carryforward or an answered scope question. Check indirect
SQL effects yourself; move affected items to the walk even if their line bytes match. Ask the
remaining `header_carry_over` as **ONE** question: **Carry over all (Recommended)** / **Walk each
individually**. List every kind/id, text, rationale, governed `location`, `decided` and observed
source commit/time, as [references/carry.rst](references/carry.rst) specifies. For date-only
attribution, explain that proof begins at the displayed source time that day, not midnight.
A later-day source or a source after a precise ISO cutoff is not eligible.

Only an **answered** Carry over all question permits copying the listed `decided` verbatim and
setting `carried_basis: "header-decision"` plus fresh `confirmed_*` for this revision from that
answer. Never invent confirmation fields from the candidate rows. Preserve an existing
independent `decided` unchanged: a provenance mismatch is walked, not overwritten to gain
eligibility. Mixed deciders matching another handle are walked with the current confirmer.
Walk each individually (or no answer/interruption) sets nothing; leave the draft unpublished
until all remaining items are answered. Publish re-proves header evidence, but cannot authenticate
who answered. A subsequent update uses normal carryforward, retaining `decided` and copying its
`set`; do not reuse header-decision as a previous-revision confirmation.

Changed, missing, shallow, ambiguous repeated/relocated ranges, relevant merge/rename evidence
and malformed/unnamed attribution go to `header_walk`. Unrelated PR merges alone do not block
eligibility. Only leading comment growth is remapped automatically; body-prefix structural
changes are conservative walks. No git history means ordinary per-item confirmation, not a
blocked review. Correctness and source authenticity still require human/source inspection.

Then put **each** remaining candidate (scope/header `walk`, or every unsettled item) to
the engineer via AskUserQuestion — batches of at most four per call, one question per item
showing its text and rationale, options **Confirm (Recommended)** / **Reword** / **Reject**.
Reworded items are asked again. Only confirmed items reach `review.json`; rejected ones stay in
the draft. If the engineer stops, leave the draft and write nothing final — say so.

**Never fill `confirmed_by`, `confirmed_at` or `confirmed_revision` from anything but an answered
question** (a bulk answer, carry-over or `bulk`, counts for the items it listed, and only those): `confirmed_by` is the user's handle (GitHub
login explicitly known, else ask; never a role label, recorder or git author; never `user.email` — `check` refuses an `@`),
`confirmed_at` is now (UTC ISO), `confirmed_revision` equals the document `revision` — except an
item carried forward on an update, which takes exactly the `set` fields `carryforward` printed.
Never set `carried_from_revision` by hand.

Before publishing SQL with a header, run `notes "<sql path>" --against` the confirmed draft.
Flag each mismatch to the human and as an open row in `questions.json`: a header item with `match: null`
(rejected or reworded) or a confirmed item the header contradicts. Suggest correcting the
pipeline's record with `/data-request:fix`.

Re-run fingerprint and compare its SHA with the bytes you reviewed; if different, reassess the
change before continuing. Write the complete confirmed document to
`.sqlreview/reviews/$SLUG/review.draft.json`, then publish it with the command below:

```json
{
  "schemaVersion": 2, "kind": "review", "slug": "<SLUG>", "sql_path": "<sql path>", "title": "…",
  "revision": 1, "recorded_at": "<UTC ISO>", "recorded_by": "<user>",
  "sql_sha256": "<from fingerprint>", "sql_body_sha256": "<from fingerprint, or null if malformed>", "git_commit": "<from fingerprint>", "git_dirty": "<boolean from fingerprint; preserve its JSON type>",
  "purpose": "…", "grain": "one row per …",
  "inputs":  [{"name": "schema.table", "description": "one row per …"}],
  "outputs": [{"name": "column", "description": "…"}],
  "logic":   [{"step": 1, "title": "…", "lines": [1, 12], "description": "…"}],
  "assumptions": [{"id": "A1", "text": "…", "rationale": "…", "location": {"lines": [3, 5]},
                   "status": "confirmed", "confirmed_by": "<user>", "confirmed_at": "<UTC ISO>", "confirmed_revision": 1}],
  "limitations": [{"id": "L1", "text": "…", "rationale": "…", "location": null,
                   "status": "confirmed", "confirmed_by": "<user>", "confirmed_at": "<UTC ISO>", "confirmed_revision": 1}],
  "question_store": "questions.json",
  "changes": [{"revision": 1, "at": "<UTC ISO>", "by": "<user>", "summary": "initial review"}]
}
```

```bash
bash "$S/sqlreview.sh" publish "$SLUG" review ".sqlreview/reviews/$SLUG/review.draft.json" || exit $?
bash "$S/sqlreview.sh" snapshot "$SLUG" "<sql path>" || exit $?  # only AFTER publish succeeds
bash "$S/sqlreview.sh" render "$SLUG" review || exit $?  # → reviews/<slug>/review.md (never hand-write it)
rm -f ".sqlreview/reviews/$SLUG/review.draft.json"
```

Show `review.md`. Continue with *After review* below.

Publish validates a staged copy, confirmations, next revision and current SQL fingerprint before
atomically replacing `review.json`, and re-proves each carried item against the previous
`review.json` and `source.sql` (so snapshot must follow every publish); on refusal, re-run
`carryforward` and walk what it lists. Never copy or patch the draft directly into the final path.
Snapshot verifies the final review hash before advancing `source.sql` and preserves
`history/<revision>.sql` for resumed explanations. Stop on any failure and keep the draft. A failed
or interrupted publish must never advance the baseline; a failed snapshot leaves the review stale. A header-only snapshot retains the authenticated original bytes; never replace historical snapshots from a claimed body match.

## After review: operator run, UAT and analyst hand-off

The Data Engineer completes `analyse`, the authorised operator run and UAT, then hands the
extract to the Data Analyst. The engineer never releases the extract. The analyst runs
`/data-request:explain`, then accepts it for release preparation, sends it back or uses
`/data-request:amend` for presentation changes. Only the analyst prepares the body through
`/data-request:release <candidate ref>` and publishes the release.

Read `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/triage/references/handoff.rst`, *Hand-off to review*.
Use that existing procedure after the operator run and UAT, including its run-evidence gate,
child-issue comment, reviewer assignment and board moves. A rendered review alone does not
complete the hand-off. Require the request runbook's **Delivery** section to point to this
same triage hand-off and name the analyst's next step; flag a missing section for the engineer.
Do not run the extract or write to GitHub without the procedure's explicit authorisation.
