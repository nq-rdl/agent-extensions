Forward the request through the `codex:cli-runtime` skill's companion `task`
contract. Read that skill before executing the task call. Run directly unless
isolation is useful or the user requests a subagent; the optional outline below
specifies the worker handoff. Do not recursively invoke `codex:rescue`.
The final user-visible response must be Codex's output verbatim.

## Preflight — Node.js runtime

Before running the companion helper or the subagent, verify Node >=18.18.0:

```bash
node -e 'const [a,b]=process.versions.node.split(".").map(Number); process.exit(a>18||(a===18&&b>=18)?0:1)'
```

Run this preflight exactly as written, as a single `Bash` command. Read the exit status and output from the Bash tool result (empty stdout on success is expected). Do not append `echo`, `;`, `&&`, pipes, or other shell separators, wrappers, or redirects; the declared grant is `Bash(node:*)`, not a general shell grant.

If that check fails (non-zero exit or `node` not found), stop and tell the user exactly: `Codex plugin requires Node.js >=18.18.0; install or upgrade Node: https://nodejs.org/en/download`. Do not surface a raw `command not found` or version error.

Raw user request:
$ARGUMENTS

Execution mode:

- If the request includes `--background`, run the forwarding task using the host’s background execution support.
- If the request includes `--wait`, run the forwarding task in the foreground.
- If neither flag is present, default to foreground.
- `--background` and `--wait` are execution flags for Claude Code. Never pass them to `task`: `task` does not parse `--wait`, so a forwarded `--wait` becomes prompt text.
- `--model` and `--effort` are runtime-selection flags. Preserve them for the forwarded `task` call, but do not treat them as part of the natural-language task text.
- If the request includes `--resume`, do not ask whether to continue. The user already chose.
- If the request includes `--fresh`, do not ask whether to continue. The user already chose.
- Otherwise, before starting Codex, check for a resumable rescue thread from this Claude session by running:

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/codex-companion.mjs" task-resume-candidate --json
```

- If that helper reports `available: true`, use `AskUserQuestion` exactly once to ask whether to continue the current Codex thread or start a new one.
- The two choices must be:
  - `Continue current Codex thread`
  - `Start a new Codex thread`
- If the user is clearly giving a follow-up instruction such as "continue", "keep going", "resume", "apply the top fix", or "dig deeper", put `Continue current Codex thread (Recommended)` first.
- Otherwise put `Start a new Codex thread (Recommended)` first.
- If the user chooses continue, add `--resume` before forwarding the task.
- If the user chooses a new thread, add `--fresh` before forwarding the task.
- If the helper reports `available: false`, do not ask. Route normally, except for a request that only says to continue ("keep going", "continue", "resume") with no task of its own: there is no Codex thread to continue in this session, so do not start a task. Tell the user and ask what Codex should do.

Forwarded command:

```bash
node "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/scripts/codex-companion.mjs" task [--write] [--resume-last] [--model <model>] [--effort <effort>] "<task text>"
```

- `--write` only when the request asks Codex to fix, implement, or otherwise change files. Omit it for investigation, diagnosis, review, research, or an explicit read-only request (the runtime then uses a read-only sandbox). Continuing a thread does not authorize edits by itself; apply the current request's scope.
- `--resume-last` only for `--resume` or the user's "continue" answer. `--fresh` and phrasing alone never add it.
- The task text is the user's request with every flag above removed.

Operating rules:

- The executor is a thin forwarder only. Use one `Bash` call to invoke the forwarded command and return that command's stdout as-is.
- Return the Codex companion stdout verbatim to the user.
- Do not paraphrase, summarize, rewrite, or add commentary before or after it.
- The executor must not inspect files, monitor progress, poll `/codex:status`, fetch `/codex:result`, call `/codex:cancel`, summarize output, or do follow-up work of its own.
- Leave `--effort` unset unless the user explicitly asks for a specific reasoning effort. Accepted efforts are `low`, `medium`, `high`, `xhigh`, `max`, and `ultra` (`ultra` is not available on either Luna); unknown values warn and pass through to Codex.
- Leave the model unset unless the user explicitly asks for one. The companion resolves aliases, so pass an alias as given; convert spoken forms first. If they ask for `spark`, map it to `gpt-5.3-codex-spark`. Bare `sol`, `terra`, or `luna` map to `gpt-5.6-sol`, `gpt-5.6-terra`, or `gpt-5.6-luna`. GPT-6 needs an explicit form: `sol-6` or "sol 6" map to `gpt-6-sol`, `luna-6` or "luna 6" to `gpt-6-luna`, `astra` to `gpt-6-astra`. There is no GPT-6 Terra; ask instead of substituting. Full alias table: `codex:model-guide`.
- If the companion fails, report the failure with its most actionable stderr lines and stop. If Codex is missing or unauthenticated, tell the user to run `/codex:setup`. Do not write a substitute answer or attempt the task yourself.
- If the user did not supply a request, ask what Codex should investigate or fix.

## Optional delegation

[references/subagent.rst](references/subagent.rst) contains the subagent outline,
handoff inputs, execution boundaries, and expected result. Read it when delegating
would help or the user asks to “create a subagent to execute this.” Otherwise,
work directly from this skill; the reference does not need to be loaded.

## Codex packaging

For execution in a native Codex package, use the host-specific entrypoint in
[references/codex.rst](references/codex.rst). The registry selects it during packaging;
the Claude entrypoint above remains the Claude workflow.
