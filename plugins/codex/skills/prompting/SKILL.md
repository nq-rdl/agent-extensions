# GPT-5.6 Prompting

Use this skill when `codex:codex-rescue` needs to ask Codex or another GPT-5.6-based workflow for help.

GPT-5.6 rewards leaner prompts than 5.4/5.5. Prompt Codex like an operator: state the task once, give the output contract, set follow-through defaults, and stop. Do not pad with repeated instructions or long natural-language explanations.

Core rules (5.6-specific):
- **State instructions once.** 5.6 follows a single clear instruction; repeating it degrades quality. Pruning redundant tools, examples, and restated rules improves both quality and token cost.
- **One autonomy / approval-boundary policy.** 5.6 is proactive. Repeated "ask first" instructions cause over-asking. Give one consolidated policy block that says when to proceed and when to stop for high-risk missing context.
- **Steer length and style with `text.verbosity`, not prose.** 5.6 is more concise than 5.5 by default. Set the parameter rather than restating "be brief" / "be thorough".
- Prefer one clear task per Codex run. Split unrelated asks into separate runs.
- Tell Codex what done looks like. Do not assume it will infer the desired end state.
- Add explicit grounding and verification rules only where unsupported guesses would hurt quality.
- Prefer better prompt contracts over raising reasoning effort or adding explanations.
- Use XML tags consistently so the prompt has stable internal structure.

Default prompt recipe:
- `<task>`: the concrete job and the relevant repository or failure context.
- `<structured_output_contract>` or `<compact_output_contract>`: exact shape, ordering, and brevity requirements.
- `<autonomy_policy>`: one block — what Codex does by default vs. when it stops for high-risk missing context. (Replaces scattered "ask first" lines.)
- `<verification_loop>` or `<completeness_contract>`: required for debugging, implementation, or risky fixes.
- `<grounding_rules>` or `<citation_rules>`: required for review, research, or anything that could drift into unsupported claims.

When to add blocks:
- Coding or debugging: add `completeness_contract`, `verification_loop`, and `missing_context_gating`.
- Review or adversarial review: add `grounding_rules`, `structured_output_contract`, and `dig_deeper_nudge`.
- Research or recommendation tasks: add `research_mode` and `citation_rules`.
- Write-capable tasks: add `action_safety` so Codex stays narrow and avoids unrelated refactors.

How to choose prompt shape:
- Use built-in `review` or `adversarial-review` commands when the job is reviewing local git changes. Those prompts already carry the review contract.
- Use `task` for diagnosis, planning, research, or implementation when you need to control the prompt directly.
- Use `task --resume-last` for follow-ups on the same Codex thread. Send only the delta instruction unless the direction changed materially.

Migration from 5.4/5.5:
- Keep your current effort baseline, then test one step lower — 5.6 often matches the old tier at less cost. See `codex:model-guide` for the ladder and per-model defaults.
- Remove step-by-step scaffolding and "think carefully" boilerplate; 5.6 does not need it.
- New-capability callouts (API-level, independent of Codex effort): prompt caching (`prompt_cache_options`), persisted reasoning (`reasoning.context`), `reasoning.mode: "pro"`, `max` effort, and the multi-agent beta (`ultra`). None of these replace a tight prompt contract.

Prompt assembly checklist:
1. Define the exact task and scope in `<task>`.
2. Choose the smallest output contract that still makes the answer easy to use.
3. Write one `<autonomy_policy>`: proceed by default, stop only for high-risk missing context.
4. Add verification, grounding, and safety tags only where the task needs them.
5. Remove redundant instructions before sending — leaner is better on 5.6.
